# That JS dude 

I took the inspiration from http://thatjsdude.com/ to make my first React website. At first I created the mockup using plain HTML and CSS. I wanted to feel the diffence between vanila JS and React development experience, that's why I first used vanila JS to build the webpage. Then I used React to do the same. The whole webpage was divided into different components and a json data was created to load the dyanamic data. Props were used for passing dynamic data from one component to another. I made a component folder in order to organize the components and imported them where necessary. Overall, It was a good experience using components, props and react environment to build a project.
